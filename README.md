# Flappy-Bird-Improved test


So after working on the older version of [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/agent1red/FlappyBird-CSharp) using basic C# and WinForms, I went ahead and took it to the next level  
using WPF and XAML coding. This was interesting to me because I was abel to design the the Form using XAML for markup  
much similar to HTML.
