# Flappy-Bird-Improved Using C# and XAML


So after working on the older version of [Flappy Bird](https://github.com/agent1red/FlappyBird-CSharp) using basic C# and WinForms, I went ahead and took it to the next level  
using WPF and XAML coding. This was interesting to me because I was able to design the Form using XAML for markup  
much like HTML. It was easier for me to visualize and use databinding. I researched into WPF and found that I can add   
objects in XAML and bind them to controls like media players. Placing objects at the start of the game was much easier than  
in WinForms as I was able to reference each object Image and loop through them with minimal code.
